            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Susan Hipple, born in 1955 in New York City, has cultivated a lifelong passion for the arts that began in her earliest years. Her foundational artistic education started with classes at the Museum of Modern Art during elementary and middle school, followed by her graduation from Elizabeth Irwin High School in 1973.</p>
            
            <p>While still in high school, Susan immersed herself in the New York art scene, studying life drawing under renowned artist Bennie Andrews at The New School for Social Research in 1972, and gaining gallery experience working at Larry Kurtz Gallery on Christopher Street. Her senior year culminated in creating theatrical sets for her school.</p>
            
            <p>Susan's formal education continued at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where she earned her Studio Art degree with an emphasis in Art History in 1977. During her college years, she expanded her experience through a technical apprenticeship at Adams Memorial Theatre and an internship at the prestigious Knoedler Gallery in NYC. She also served as a guide at the Clark Art Institute, deepening her understanding of art history and curation.</p>
            
            <p>Her senior exhibition at the Williams College Museum of Art in 1977, under the guidance of Professor Tom Krens, marked the beginning of her professional artistic career. Following graduation, Susan worked as a designer at Union Tee Shirt factory in North Adams, Massachusetts, applying her artistic skills to commercial design.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout the 1980s and beyond, Susan became an integral part of the Pennsylvania arts community. She participated in and won ribbons at the Juniata County Fair, joined the Northern Tier Art Association and the Mifflin/Juniata Arts Association. Her commitment to arts education led her to serve as "Picture Lady" in public school systems across At. Marys and Juniata County, where she introduced students to art and artists, extending this educational mission to local public libraries.</p>
            
            <p>From 1993 to 2007, Susan served as Children's Librarian at Juniata County Library in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania, where she emphasized creative processes and projects. The library continues to own and display her artwork as a testament to her lasting impact.</p>
            
            <p>Susan's artistic achievements include notable exhibitions: a solo show at ABC Gallery in Harrisburg in 2007, participation in the Big Tree Festival art shows, and exhibitions at Juniata County Library in 2009 and 2023. She was also a member of the Bentwash collective artists website in 2010, connecting with artists nationwide.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond visual arts, Susan's creative spirit extended to music as a singer-songwriter for The Heggs (alternative country) and the Academia Blues Company. Her artistic versatility also encompasses practical applicationsâ€”from 1979 to present, she has personally restored four houses across Pennsylvania, demonstrating her commitment to bringing beauty and creativity to everyday spaces.</p>
            
            <p>Susan Hipple's work reflects a lifetime dedicated to artistic expression, education, and community engagement, making her a cherished figure in Pennsylvania's cultural landscape.</p>
